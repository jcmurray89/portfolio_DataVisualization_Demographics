This is an anonymized version of a project I created for a Data Analyst job at a local school district. The district provided an excel file with the hiring date, specialty, race/ethnicity, and school of the current employees. 

Presentation Materials: 

	Murray_School_Project_Pres.pptx  - final manager-ready presentation as a slide deck

Code: 

	Murray_School_Project_Final.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook (python). The bulk of the calculations were done here. 
	Census Data Setup.txt - text file copy of code block from MySQL (SQL). Used to format US Census data on Polk County before adding to main project.
